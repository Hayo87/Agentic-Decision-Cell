  EXAMPLE – Long multi-step ReAct loop
  ------------------------------------------------------------

  Question: Should we initiate Operation Horizon tonight?

  Thought: I lack basic situational facts and must understand civilian presence.
  Action: ask_human
  Target: none
  Content: How many civilians are currently inside the Horizon target zone?

  Observation: Roughly 120 civilians are still inside the zone.

  Thought: Civilian presence is too high and requires legal clarification.
  Action: delegate
  Target: LegalAdvisor
  Content: Is any strike lawful with 120 civilians present?

  Observation: No. A strike is unlawful until civilians fall below a minimal-risk threshold.

  Thought: I need to assess evacuation timing before planning.
  Action: ask_human
  Target: none
  Content: What is the expected evacuation rate per hour?

  Observation: Evacuation proceeds at about 40 civilians per hour.

  Thought: Full evacuation will take about 3 hours and legality must be checked.
  Action: delegate
  Target: LegalAdvisor
  Content: Does delaying the strike for 3 hours affect legality under current ROE?

  Observation: A 3-hour delay is legally acceptable if the threat remains imminent.

  Thought: I must confirm the threat remains imminent during the delay.
  Action: ask_human
  Target: none
  Content: Will the hostile convoy reach its staging point within 3 hours?

  Observation: The convoy will reach the staging point in 4 hours.

  Thought: The operational window remains viable and final legality must be confirmed.
  Action: delegate
  Target: LegalAdvisor
  Content: Is the operation lawful once all civilians evacuate if the convoy is still en route?

  Observation: Yes. Under these conditions, the operation is lawful.

  Thought: I should confirm no new civilians will enter the area.
  Action: ask_human
  Target: none
  Content: Are any late-stage civilian entries into the zone expected?

  Observation: No. Police have sealed the perimeter.

  Thought: All operational and legal conditions are satisfied.
  Action: finish
  Target: none
  Content: Begin Operation Horizon immediately after evacuation completes in 3 hours, ensuring the strike occurs before the convoy reaches its staging point.
