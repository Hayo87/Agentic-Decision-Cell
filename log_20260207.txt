│                    could be stealthy, but if detected, it might lead to attribution.   │
│                    Proportionality is a concern because taking down the power grid     │

│                    DDoS is hard to trace, but if the vulnerability is known, others    │
│                    might exploit it. Proportionality is better since it targets        │
│                    fueling, which is specific, but DDoS effectiveness could be an      │
│                    issue                                                               │
